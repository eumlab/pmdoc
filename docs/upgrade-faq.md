## I have previously purchased the Pro Version of Pro Metronome, do I need to pay for the subscription again?
If you have previously purchased the full version of Pro Metronome on your iTunes/Apple Store account, you can still unlock the premium features by clicking "Restore Purchase" while logged into that account.

If you are unable to use the app after restoring the purchase, you can send us an Email(<team@eumlab.com>) with your purchase history from the App Store.

If you had unlocked the full version through social sharing, you can also contact us via Email(<team@eumlab.com>). We will provide you with a redeem code, and you can continue to use the new version of Pro Metronome for free for one year.
